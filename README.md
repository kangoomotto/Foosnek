# Foosnek
Foosnek is a fast-paced, turn-based soccer + board + quiz hybrid game. Two players (PvP or PvCPU) roll dice, move chips across a dynamic board filled with slot effects, and answer quizzes to gain points, launch penalty kicks, or get punished. Visual feedback, tactical decisions, and educational content drive engagement.
